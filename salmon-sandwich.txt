INGREDIENTS

8 ounces skinless salmon fillet
6 ounces smoked salmon, chopped
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup chopped celery
1 tablespoon chopped chives
1 tablespoon chopped capers
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
black pepper
lettuce leaves
8 slices pumpernickel bread

DIRECTIONS

Heat oven to 450° F. Roast the salmon fillet on a rimmed baking sheet until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes; let cool, then flake.
Combine the smoked salmon, mayonnaise, celery, chives, capers, lemon zest, flaked salmon, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl.
Divide the salmon salad and lettuce leaves among the bread.


Mix freshly roasted salmon with smoked salmon for a delicious filling that’s not overpowering. 
Bonus: The salmon mixture can be made up to 3 days in advance.
